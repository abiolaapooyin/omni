2. **Create Deployment Package**
   ```bash
   # Remove existing build artifacts
   rm -rf .next node_modules
   
   # Install dependencies
   npm install
   
   # Build the application
   npm run build
   
   # Create deployment package
   zip -r omni-server-deployment.zip . -x "node_modules/*" ".next/*" "package-lock.json" "out/*" "*.zip"
   ```

### Step 2: Setup Node.js Application in cPanel
1. **Access Node.js Setup**
   - Login to your Namecheap cPanel account
   - Go to **Software** section
   - Click **Setup Node.js App**

2. **Create New Application**
   - Click **Create Application**
   - **Node.js Version:** Select **14.x**
   - **Application Mode:** Production
   - **Application Root:** Type `/omni` (creates omni directory)
   - **Application URL:** Leave as `abiola.ca/omni`
   - **Application Startup File:** `server.js`
   - Click **Create**

3. **Test Initial Setup**
   - Click **Open** to test the default Node.js application
   - Verify it shows "It works!" message
   - Click **Stop App** to prepare for file upload

### Step 3: Upload Project Files
1. **Access File Manager**
   - Go to **File Manager** in cPanel
   - Navigate to the `/omni` directory created by Node.js app

2. **Upload and Extract**
   - Upload `omni-server-deployment.zip` to the `/omni` directory
   - Right-click the zip file and select **Extract**
   - Delete the zip file after extraction

3. **Refresh Node.js Application**
   - Return to **Setup Node.js App**
   - Click **Restart** to refresh the application

### Step 4: Install Dependencies and Start
1. **Install Dependencies**
   - In the Node.js App interface, click **Run npm install**
   - Wait for installation to complete (may take a few minutes)

# Application Settings
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME=Omni AI
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_DESCRIPTION=Multi-agent AI experiment

# Production Settings
NODE_ENV=production
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_ANALYTICS=true
```

### Security Notes
- Environment variables are included in the build
- Langflow API has proper CORS settings configured
- Production-ready server configuration included

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Deployment Issues

**Problem:** Node.js application shows an error
- ‚úÖ Verify `server.js` is in the root of your application directory
- ‚úÖ Check that the Node.js version in cPanel is compatible
- ‚úÖ Ensure all files were extracted correctly
- ‚úÖ Try restarting the application from the cPanel interface

**Problem:** `npm install` fails
- ‚úÖ Check for internet connectivity issues in cPanel
- ‚úÖ Verify that `package.json` is present and valid
- ‚úÖ Try stopping and starting the application again
- ‚úÖ Check for sufficient disk space in your hosting account

**Problem:** Application starts but shows errors
- ‚úÖ Check that the `.next` build folder was created successfully
- ‚úÖ Verify that environment variables are set correctly in cPanel
- ‚úÖ Test that your API endpoints are accessible
- ‚úÖ Check the browser console for any client-side errors

**Problem:** AI chat functionality is not working
- ‚úÖ Verify that your Langflow API key is correct
- ‚úÖ Check the CORS settings on your Langflow API
- ‚úÖ Test the API endpoint directly in your browser
- ‚úÖ Check the network tab in your browser's developer tools for failed requests

## üìÅ File Checklist

### For Tutorial-Based Server Deployment:
- ‚úÖ `server.js` with production hostname configuration
